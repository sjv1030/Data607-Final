Betting Against Beta in the S&P 500

BACKGROUND:

In most standard Finance 101 courses, students are taught that the higher the risk, the higher the reward (i.e., only take on more risk, if reward increases as well). This ideology is ingrained in many theories, most notably in the Capital Asset Pricing Model where the return of a stock is linearly associated to the risk sensitivity (i.e., beta) to the broader equity market (e.g., S&P 500). As a result, individuals that aren't risk averse and wanted higher returns, ended up taking on more risk in their portfolio by selecting risker (higher beta) stocks.

However, in 2010, Andrea Frazzini and Lasse H. Pedersen published a paper titled "Betting Against Beta" (http://www.nber.org/papers/w16601) where they show empirically that lower beta stocks (less risky stocks) actually outperform higher beta stocks (higher risky stocks).

Many investors have been able to reproduce similar results and some have even launched investment funds following this methodology.

This code attempts to reproduce the study. However, due to various data limitations and difference in beta calculation, this attempt doesn't result in the same conclusion.
